## üöÄ Project Description

**Relay** is a modern, real-time messaging web application that mimics the feel of today‚Äôs top messaging platforms. With secure authentication, dynamic **Socket.IO-based** communication, and a polished responsive UI, it delivers a seamless chat experience. Whether you‚Äôre sending text, photos, or videos, everything happens in real-time ‚Äî no refresh required.

The project demonstrates full-stack proficiency with features like JWT-based authentication, password hashing via `bcryptjs`, file uploads to **Cloudinary**, and live updates via **Socket.IO** ‚Äî all built around a **clean modular architecture** in both frontend and backend.

## ‚ú® Key Features

**User Authentication:**

*   Secure sign up and login using **bcryptjs** for password hashing.
